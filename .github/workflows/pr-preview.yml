# Branch Preview (GitHub Pages)
# -----------------------------
# What this workflow does:
# - Every time you push to (almost) any branch, it builds a small static site into `dist/`
# - Then it publishes that `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch under:
#     branch-preview/<branch-name>/
#
# Why this exists:
# - It lets you preview changes from any branch without merging to the “main” deploy path
#
# Where previews show up:
# - Your repo’s GitHub Pages base URL + `/branch-preview/<branch-name>/`
#   Example:
#     https://<org-or-user>.github.io/<repo>/branch-preview/my-feature-branch/
#
# Key implementation detail:
# - We do NOT overwrite the whole `gh-pages` branch each time.
# - `keep_files: true` tells the deploy action to keep other existing preview folders.
#
# Heads-up about cleanup:
# - This workflow *creates/updates* previews, but it does not delete them.

      # 1) Pull the repo contents into the runner so we can build from them.

      # 2) Install Python so we can run the build script.

      # 3) Build the preview site into `dist/`.
      # - We create `dist/` if it doesn't exist
      # - We run our generator script to produce HTML output
      # - We add `.nojekyll` so GitHub Pages serves files as-is (no Jekyll processing)

      # 4) Publish `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch under a branch-specific subfolder.
      #
      # destination_dir: branch-preview/${{ github.ref_name }}
      # - github.ref_name is the short branch name (e.g., "my-feature-branch")
      # - so the final path becomes: branch-preview/my-feature-branch/
      #
      # keep_files: true
      # - keeps previously-published previews for other branches
      # - without this, each publish can wipe out other preview folders
